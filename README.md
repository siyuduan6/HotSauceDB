# HotSauceDB
CS411 Project

In the previous stages, we designed all the database components for our application. Now it is time to connect your database to the front-end application. For this stage, your team is expected to build a simple user interface that interacts with the database you developed in Stage 3. Please note that we do not grade based on how fancy your user interface is. We grade based on the functionality of your interface and how it connects to the database.

As a team, you should create a simple user interface that performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and search operations on the table(s) you created in stage 3. You must implement each operation at least once (5+ operations: CRUD & Search) and they can each be on different tables. Try to make the interfaces and operations relevant to your application! The expected functions along with their rubric are listed below. 

# Insert new records (rows) to the database (3%):

0% if no interface for this operation is present

+0.5% for having the code connecting the interface with the database

+1.5% for having the interface for insertion

+1% for successfully inserting to the database

# Search the database using a keyword search. Your application should allow the user to input their search keyword and return the result to the interface (5%):

0% if no interface for this operation is present

+0.5% for having the code connecting the interface with the database

+1.5 % for having a textbox for entering the search keyword

+3% for the successful execution of the query and the returning the result to the interface

# Update records on the database (3%):

0% if no interface for this operation is present

+0.5% for having the code connecting the interface with the database

+1% for having the interface for update

+1.5% for successfully updating the database

# Delete rows from the database (3%):

0% if no interface for this operation is present

+0.5% for having the code connecting the interface with the database

+1% for having the interface for deletion

+1.5% for successfully deleting row(s) from the database

# Integrate into your application both of the advanced SQL queries you developed in stage 3. (6%):

0% if no interface for this operation is present

+0.5% for having the code connecting the interface with the database

+4% for having the interface for the advanced queries

+1.5% for successfully executing the advanced queries
